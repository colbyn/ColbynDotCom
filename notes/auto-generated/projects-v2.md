### 2018

**SubSys/Compiler**
∙ Elm-to‑Rust compiler implemented in Haskell. Prototype explored type-safe code generation and cross-language compilation pipelines.

**colbyn/commands**
∙ Bash-inspired DSL for building structured CLI workflows with indentation sensitivity, function definitions, and multiline strings.
∙ Simplifies scripts like AWS deployments, Postgres provisioning, Chrome auto-launch, and parallel task runs—providing a clean override to overly verbose tooling.

---

### 2019

**Imager Project / [imager](https://github.com/imager-io/imager)**
∙ Rust-based, automated image optimizer that uses ML-based perceptual scoring in a brute-force trial-and-error approach, achieving significantly smaller output sizes than tools like kraken.io or jpegmini ([GitHub][1]).
∙ Benchmarks show reducing \~39 MB input to \~4.2 MB compressed output over four images ([GitHub][1]).

**Key subprojects:**

* **imager-io-js**: Node.js binding wrapping Rust engine with zero dependencies; non-blocking API for seamless integration ([GitHub][2]).
* **Bindings & codecs**: Rust adapters for WebP (`webp-dev-rs`), FFmpeg (`ffmpeg-dev-rs`), x264 (`x264-dev`), and Netflix VMAF algorithm for video perceptual scoring (`vmaf-sys`) ([GitHub][3]).

**web-images-js**
∙ Zero-dependency Node library for fast, safe image loading and conversion—with bundled Rust binaries. Avoids system dependencies like libvips or ImageMagick and delivers efficient web asset pipelines.

---

### 2020

**Subscript HTML Toolchain & Educational Notes**
∙ Created tools to compile structured math and chemistry notes into self-contained, responsive web pages with autogenerated TOCs and compact layout.
∙ Projects include [math notes](https://colbyn.github.io/school-notes-spring-2020/) and [chemistry notebook](https://colbyn.github.io/old-school-chem-notes/dev/chemistry-1010---fall-2021/index.html).
∙ Developed Subscript repository (mono-repo) to unify markup, rendering, and publishing workflows into a single toolchain.

---

### 2021

**AMI Uploader**
∙ Rust CLI utility to upload Amazon Machine Images (VMware VMDK) to S3, designed to work seamlessly with LinuxKit workflows. Enables repeatable image deployment pipelines using Rust + AWS S3.

---

### 2022

**Subscript Publishing Platform**
∙ Comprehensive content and note-taking platform built around LaTeX-inspired HTML-ish syntax with macros (\name\[…] {}) and scripting support.
∙ Features include layout control, asset globbing, TOC macros, Unicode prettification, dark/light mode, and iPad hand‑drawn note integration.
∙ Advanced features include local rewrite rules (`\\where!`), syntax-aware macro expansion, and PDF rendering via paged.js (WIP).

---

### 2023

**punk-lang**
∙ Experimental programming language with LaTeX‑style syntax, nesting-aware color highlighting, designed to support rich editor tooling and syntax visualization.

**Subscript Remake**
∙ Redesigned Subscript UI for macOS/iOS with revamped editor and HTML renderer, improving usability and visual polish across platforms.

---

### 2024

**MonadoParser (Swift)**
∙ Composable, monadic parser combinator framework in Swift enabling lossless parsing with full positional tracking, error handling, and functional chaining (`Parser<A>`, `ParserState`, `Tape`) ([GitHub][4], [GitHub][5]).

**SwiftyTextEffects & SwiftyMarkdown**
∙ Follow-up experiments in Swift for markdown parsing with a lossless AST representation—aimed at powering robust text rendering.

**pretty-tree-rs & SwiftPrettyTree**
∙ Rust and Swift libraries for visually structured tree/debug printouts—useful in compiler and AST debugging contexts.

**ChatGPT Dictionary Compiler**
∙ Closed-source pipeline that transforms LLM-generated multilingual dictionary/flashcard data into optimized language learning datasets.

---

### 2025

**SuperSwiftMarkdownPrototype**
∙ Native proof-of-concept markdown renderer for macOS/iOS supporting full GitHub-flavored markdown block types, selection-based navigation, and multi-cursor editing, including rich table behaviors and cursor-aware text layout ([GitHub][6]).

**SuperSwiftMarkup**
∙ Ground-up, fresh rewrite of the markdown rendering stack. Goals include cross-platform markdown view components with horizontal scrolling for wide blocks, robust user interaction, and first-class text navigation—designed for future adoption in real apps.
