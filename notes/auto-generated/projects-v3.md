### 2018

#### [SubSys/Compiler](https://github.com/SubSys/Compiler)

An experimental compiler translating Elm to Rust, implemented in Haskell. The project explored type-safe code generation and language interoperability, demonstrating cross-functional use of statically typed languages in compiler construction.

#### [colbyn/commands](https://github.com/colbyn/commands)

A bash-inspired scripting tool for structuring CLI workflows with minimal overhead. Provides an indentation-sensitive syntax, embedded functions, multiline strings, and command aliasing. Examples include automating AWS deployments, database provisioning, image builds, and parallel task execution.

Key Features:

* DSL for ergonomic scripting without needing Make.
* Simplified interface for verbose tools like the AWS CLI.
* Includes command grouping, silent blocks, and structured output parsing.
