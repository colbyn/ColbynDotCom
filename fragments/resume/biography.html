    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="justified">
      Self-taught systems builder with a background in functional programming and years spent crafting custom parsers, transforming ASTs, and working from first principles. My path has been unconventional, shaped by independent technical work that prioritized depth over conformity. I work best where off-the-shelf tools break down — especially in Rust, Swift, and domains requiring tight control.

    <h2>Tooling Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="justified">
      I build tools I can reason about end-to-end. Whether it’s a compiler or a templating DSL, I care about determinism, clarity, and making brittle problems tractable by reshaping them at the tooling layer.

    <h2>Fit</h2>
    <p class="justified">
      I’m drawn to roles where conventional tools fall short — places that need structural thinkers and builders who prefer clarity over convenience.
