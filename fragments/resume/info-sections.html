    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="justified">
        I fell in love with purely functional programming in my late teens and went deep — pattern matching, sum types,
        and Hindley-Milner type inference became second nature. While not a professional compiler engineer, I’ve spent
        years building parsers, modeling data structures, and transforming ASTs — an experience that shaped my approach
        to solving abstract, technically difficult problems from first principles.
    </p>
    <p class="justified">
        I’ve taken a nontraditional path — spending most of my twenties pursuing independent technical work.
        It taught me how to solve hard problems (though not always how to make money from them). Today, I’m
        especially strong in systems involving Rust and Swift, particularly in domains that demand deep control,
        like custom TextKit2 rendering or workflows where off-the-shelf tools — including AI — fall short.

    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Subscript — Native Note-Taking App:</strong>
            A Swift-based tool with custom markup-based typesetting and topic-centric navigation.
            Notes compile into self-hostable HTML archives — blending structured knowledge capture with long-term
            portability.
            Designed for clarity and durability, not platform lock-in.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>WebCompiler — Static Site Compiler:</strong>
            A Rust toolchain that replaces CMS platforms. Supports macro-style HTML transforms, AI-generated content
            scaffolding, and modular DOM post-processing. Powers all my client and personal web work.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Compiler Generator for Language Datasets:</strong>
            Generates bilingual dictionary and phrasebook datasets from EPUB sources using prompt-chained LLMs. Features
            deterministic preprocessing,
            error recovery, retry logic, and structured output validation. Output compiles into native SQLite + SwiftUI
            app
            bundles.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Maps Payload Modeling:</strong>
            Reverse engineered the obfuscated JSON structures behind <code>tbm=map</code> search views to build a custom
            lead-generation pipeline. Includes geographic hierarchy modeling and canonical business entity mapping.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tooling Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="justified">
        I prefer tools that I can reason about from the ground up. That’s why I often build my own — whether it’s a site
        compiler, a prompt templating system, or a dataset generator. I value clarity, determinism, and structural
        control
        over off-the-shelf flexibility. When a problem is weird, brittle, or ill-defined, I work backwards until the
        tooling makes it tractable.

    <h2>Technologies I Work With</h2>
    <p><strong>Languages:</strong> Rust, Swift, TypeScript, HTML/CSS</p>
    <p><strong>Concepts:</strong> AST design, type inference, static analysis, compiler pipelines, data modeling</p>
    <p><strong>Ecosystems:</strong> iOS (UIKit, AppKit, TextKit2), Web (DOM automation, SEO, AI content scaffolding, design systems)</p>
    <h2>What I’m Looking For</h2>
    <p class="justified">
        I’m best suited for roles with real constraints and unconventional problems — where off-the-shelf solutions
        don’t apply. Whether it’s parsing data no one wants to touch or building tools that restore control to the developer, I bring a structural mindset, a toolmaker’s instinct, and a focus on long-term clarity.
