        </h3>
        <p>In my first semester at UVU I took CS1400 by professor Bianca Ruiz, who then offered me a grading position at the end of the semester. I enjoyed this job and wish I stayed (I took trigonometry and calculus concurrently and was expecting subsequent semesters to be just as difficult).</p>
        <p>The instructor said my code looked “beautiful” before I signed up as a grader.</p>

        <h3>The HTML Toolchain</h3>
        <p>

            <a href="https://github.com/subscript-publishing/subscript-html"

        </p>
        <p>
            A custom publishing system that reimagines LaTeX for the web. Designed to turn structured STEM notes into
            responsive, navigable documents — blending handwritten diagrams, inline math, and semantic HTML in one
            toolchain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional LaTeX-to-PDF pipelines, this system outputs fully interactive HTML with live navigation,
            mobile-ready layout, and auto-generated metadata. Built for note-taking first, publishing second.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Autogenerated tables of contents and section links.</li>
            <li>Hybrid support for typeset and hand-drawn inputs.</li>
            <li>Responsive layout tuned for cross-device academic reading.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Beautiful Math Notes</h3>

        <p>
            A real-world testbed for Subscript’s HTML toolchain — compiling a semester of math coursework into an
            interactive, web-native format. Features richly formatted equations, diagrams, and dynamic TOC navigation
            across topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project illustrates how digital notes can preserve mathematical rigor without compromising on usability
            or design.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean math typesetting with inline and block notation.</li>
            <li>Linked headings and deep navigation for modular study.</li>
            <li>Designed for screen reading, not PDF output.</li>
        </ul>
