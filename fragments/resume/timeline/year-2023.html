            A deliberately minimal markup language with LaTeX-inspired syntax and depth-sensitive highlighting —
            designed to test how little structure is needed to express complex educational content clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The language focuses on parseability and pedagogical clarity: every visual highlight is tied to syntactic
            depth, making nested logic or derivations easier to follow for learners. Built as a sketchpad for better
            markup ergonomics.
        </p>

        <h4>Key Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean, expressive syntax for STEM writing and teaching.</li>
            <li>Depth-aware syntax highlighting for conceptual layering.</li>
            <li>Structured output with minimal rules — optimized for parsing.</li>
        </ul>

            <span class="outline">Subscript</span>
            Freeform Note-Taking App (iOS/macOS)
        </h3>

        <p>
            A handwritten, vector-based note-taking app built from scratch to prioritize <strong>human expression,
                long-term readability, and semantic structure</strong>—a radical departure from PDF-constrained or
            AI-assisted systems. Originally released on the App Store, I later withdrew it to re-architect the data
            model and rethink structural primitives.
        </p>

        <p>
            The app uses a custom model space for device-independent rendering, handwritten stroke capture with
            velocity-aware smoothing (via a Swift port of <code>perfect-freehand</code>), and a semantically driven
            outline system (H1–H6) for navigation and TOC generation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Subscript reflects a broader philosophy: <strong>separation of content and presentation</strong>, inspired
            by LaTeX, combined with the authenticity of freeform input—a medium resistant to AI mimicry.
