            <span class="outline">Subscript</span>
            Freeform Note-Taking App (iOS/macOS)
        </h3>

        <p>A handwritten, vector-based note-taking app built from scratch to prioritize <strong>human expression, long-term readability, and semantic structure</strong>. Originally released on the App Store, I later withdrew it to re-architect the data model and rethink some things.</p>

        <p>The app uses a custom model space for device-independent rendering, handwritten stroke capture with velocity-aware smoothing (via a Swift port of <code>perfect-freehand</code>), and a semantically driven outline system (H1–H6) for navigation and TOC generation.</p>

        <p>Subscript reflects a broader philosophy: <strong>separation of content and presentation</strong>, inspired by LaTeX, combined with the authenticity of freeform input—a medium resistant to AI mimicry.</p>
