<h2 class="title">About Me</h2>

<div class="wrapped">
    <p>I'm an independent software researcher and writer focused on identifying and executing new methodologies for building software that just "feels right."</p>

    <h3>Why Software Research Matters</h3>

    <p>In the modern landscape, ideas are cheap. Methodology is leverage. The age of obvious wins is over and what remains are complex, layered problems that resist surface-level solutions. As in deep sea oil prospecting, success now comes not from foresight alone, but from adaptive exploration.</p>

    <p>Much like how neural networks evolve from randomness into purpose through iteration, software innovation today demands the same mindset. The emergence of tools like ChatGPT makes it plain: static planning is obsolete. You either iterate or become irrelevant.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Choose methodology over foresight.</li>
        <li>Choose adaptive exploration over static frameworks.</li>
        <li>Choose research when answers can't be seen upfront.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Researchers operate in the dark. They chase what can't yet be mapped. They don't guess they probe, iterate, and refine. The best of them are curious, disciplined, and exacting. That is the archetype I embody.</p>

    <p>I write because I want the software I use to feel right. Most of it doesn't. Most of it is designed around business models, not experience. But truly great software does more than just "work" it changes the way people think and operate.</p>

    <h3>Principles</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Don’t chase success. Build methodology.</li>
        <li>Avoid defaulting to societal definitions of achievement.</li>
        <li>Ignore the playbook. Make a better one.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Success is easy. That's its problem. Depth has a cost, those unwilling to pay it should stay on the surface. I’m guided by a different metric: elegance.</p>

    <p>As for tech bros: they optimize for the wrong variables. Web clients everywhere. Native software stagnates. Everyone's chasing the obvious, no one's chasing feel. We need new primitives, not more frameworks.</p>

    <h3>Selected Projects (Open Source Only)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Hand-drawn Notes as Webpages</strong>
            <p>Freeform, resolution-independent publishing with novel dark mode support.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Brute Force Image Compression Optimizer</strong>
            <p>Unorthodox but effective. Long story.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Markdown Renderer for iOS/macOS</strong>
            <p>GitHub Flavored Markdown, multi-cursor, native text selection via TextKit 2.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Indentation-Based Shell Scripting Language</strong>
            <p>Cleaner syntax, multiline support, higher-order functions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Monadic Parser Combinator Library in Swift</strong>
            <p>Parser state propagated implicitly; elegant and clean.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Someone should build a Markdown-based spreadsheet app using my renderer. Native UI, scrollable layout fragments — it would outperform every existing option.</p>

    <p>This is not a portfolio. It’s a declaration: I don’t follow systems. I build better ones.</p>
