<p><strong>Welcome to the SubScript Note-Taking &amp; Content Publishing Tools</strong></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Tools to accommodate my preferred note-taking workflow, from beautifully typeset (but relatively time consuming) LaTeX math and other markup, to rapid hand drawn notes when time constrained — <strong>all in one and seamlessly intermixed</strong>.

<p>Features</p>

<p>Content publishing VIA Web-Technologies!</p>

<p>
    There are TONS of JS libs that do very specific things (for literally everything) that no-one ever uses outside perhaps an official web-app, for instance Desmos and GeoGebra are trivially embeddable but people hardly ever use their JS APIs. The goal of Subscript is to make this as convenient as possible with a declarative non-programming API for each. Something akin to e.g. exclusively using HTML tags for each in a declarative manner.
</p>
<p>
    In a certain regard, SubScript is basically LaTeX, except, while you loose out on it&#39;s massive array of packages that do everything from math to extremely fine tuned musical notation rendering, you instead get a WIP LaTeX-like interface to the COLOSSAL JS ecosystem.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        For instance, need to publish content with musical notation? Maybe I&#39;ll one day add support for
        <a href="https://www.vexflow.com">VexFlow</a>
        so I say that Subscript supports rendering complex musical notation. Can markdown do that? Or better yet, will markdown ever do that?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In 2022 popular markdown displays are finally getting support for displaying math, but it&#39;s still relatively limited with regards to the feature-set LaTeX provides.
</p>
<p>
    The goal of Subscript is to be a <strong>monolithic publishing platform</strong> for everything under the sun, and by monolithic, I mean monolithic. While red flags may go off in your head, I&#39;ve tried AsciiDoc, and the problem with AsciiDoc is that it&#39;s both slow, incredibly slow after a while, and especially, there&#39;s no syntax highlighting or autocomplete of embedded content! In theory AsciiDoc&#39;s idea of extensibility sounds nice, it may please your enterprise system architect, but it leads to a multitude of annoyances (to say the least) that you simply don&#39;t have with LaTeX. Furthermore, AsciiDoc makes assumptions that wouldn&#39;t easily translate to a browser environment. Whereas a monolithic architecture entails end-to-end uniformity.
</p>
<p>
    In theory, Markdown based content publishing tools has the same issue, I&#39;ve seen platforms built upon markdown with extra features, but will your stock markdown syntax highlighter support such? Whereas e.g. if you see a LaTeX package, odds are it supports the entirety of (Xe)LaTeX syntax and whatnot.
</p>

<p>Subscript Markup Language</p>

<ul>
    <li>Built upon LaTeX-ified HTML tags.<ul>
            <li>Meta:<ul>
                    <li>(Except in Subscript, instead of calling things like <code>\h1{…}</code> a tag, it&#39;s a
                        command (you can go on calling it a tag, idc. Originally, in the compiler implementation I used
                        the tag terminology for relevant names, but this was later changed without any particular
                        conscious reason, perhaps&#39;s it was just less confusing given it&#39;s LaTeX-like syntax,
                        regardless this is what stuck.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Therefore, in Subscript:<ul>
                    <li>all command identifiers begin with a slash <code>\</code> (which is an easy trigger for
                        auto-complete),</li>
                    <li>while macros with specially implemented behavior (in the compiler) end in an exclamation mark
                        (<code>!</code>) (inspired by rust).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>A command is broken down into</strong> <code>\name[attributes]{arguments}</code></li>
            <li>For instance,<ul>
                    <li><code>\h1{Hello World}</code></li>
                    <li><code>\include[src=&quot;./path/to/filename.ss&quot;]</code></li>
                    <li><code>\layout[cols=3]{…}</code></li>
                    <li><code>\frac{1}{2}</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Generally speaking:<ul>
                    <li>For all HTML based commands, the overall format is<ul>
                            <li><code>\name[attributes]{argument}</code> or <code>\name[attributes]</code></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>For all LaTeX based commands, the overall format is <ul>
                            <li><code>\name[attributes]{arg1}{arg2}…{argN}</code></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Some commands are only available if it&#39;s nested under a <code>parent</code> command, for instance,
                <code>\row</code> is only available if it&#39;s nested under a <code>\table</code> command. (It&#39;s a
                variable arity/argument convenience command for creating a table row where each argument is
                automatically wrapped in in a table-data element (if its not already), since HTML tables are very
                verbose and I&#39;ve been trying to streamline their creation for fast notes).<ul>
                    <li>(I call these convenience commands that simply expand out to more verbose HTML trees &quot;HTML
                        sugar&quot;)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Compile your notes to HTML webpages, or PDF files (very long-term WIP).</li>
    <li>Seamlessly intermix markup with hand drawn content VIA the Subscript Freeform Tools (iPad only).</li>
    <li>Seamless dark/light mode support throughout all subscript tools. </li>
</ul>

    Also the <code>\math</code> command support a few options for quickly defining common environments and whatnot, as shown in the following example (the <code>num</code> and <code>tag</code> options also work for <code>\equation</code>):

<p>When I update the <code>\where!</code> macro to support rewriting attributes, you&#39;ll be able to use such to keep track of labels within a local expression. Which will be something akin to:</p>
<img src="../../../assets/images/legacy/subscript/where-labels.png" alt="Where labels" class="boxed">
<p>By default numbered expressions are turned off, because I want a better interface for such than what KaTeX provides.
</p>
<p>Layout</p>
<p>Things can be broken down into newspaper like columns VIA the <code>\layout[col=num]</code> command, for instance,</p>

<img src="../../../assets/images/legacy/subscript/newpaper-like-layout.png" alt="Where labels" class="floating">


<p>
    By default this also includes breakpoints that will decrement columns as the viewport width decreases until it breaks into single column mode.
</p>

<p>While the <code>\grid</code> command gives you access to very fine tuned CSS grids:</p>
<img src="../../../assets/images/legacy/subscript/grid-layout.png" alt="Where labels" class="floating">

<p>File Import Support With Relative Headings</p>
<p>For example</p>
<img src="../../../assets/images/legacy/subscript/include-syntax-example.png" alt="Include syntax example" class="boxed">

<p>
    Furthermore, this rule is recursively applied in a bottom-up fashion when files import other files that import other files and so forth (I really wish there were more HTML heading tags). So in any <code>.ss</code> file, always begin with H1 and decrement sub-headings relative to such (so the headings therefrom will result in the appropriate level in any given hierarchical context of file imports).
</p>

<p>Automatic Table Of Content Generation</p>

<p>Currently being reimplemented to better handle multi-page and nested (hierarchical) page layouts.</p>

<p>Currently looks like this (in dark mode):</p>
<img src="../../../assets/images/legacy/subscript/toc-preview.png" alt="TOC example" class="floating">

<p>Unicode Support and Typography:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The parser is based on the <code>unicode-segmentation</code> crate (which identifies Grapheme Cluster, Word and
        Sentence boundaries according to Unicode Standard Annex #29 rules).</li>
    <li>Unicode beautification of characters such as mapping <code>&quot;...&quot;</code> → <code>“…”</code></li>
</ul>

    <li>Freeform files are essentially vector objects and are therefore resolution independent.</li>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        This interface is <strong>unstable and likely to change</strong> and may currently be broken.
    </li>
    <li>
        At the time of this writing, drawing rewrite rules are only supported for <code>.ss1-drawing</code> files, since
        <code>.ss1-composition</code> files are more complicated and I haven&#39;t worked out how the interface should work.
