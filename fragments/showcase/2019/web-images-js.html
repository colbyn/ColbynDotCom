<p>Safe - Fast (and Non Blocking) - Dependency free - MIT License (with no GPL extras) - Image Loading, Resizing, Conversion and Processing.</p>

<ul>
    <li>No annoying system requirements on libvips, ImageMagic and etcetera. There are rust dependencies yet everything is baked into the release binary and requires no further dependencies.</li>
    <li>Bugs are inevitable and furthermore what bridges the JS world with the rust implementation is the low-level NAPI interface. Yet while the picture isn’t perfect, the FFI boundary is rather small in comparison. If you buy into Rust and it’s semantics, this should *at the very least* be a step in the right direction.</li>
</ul>
