<h3>Freeform, Human-Centric, and Built from the Ground Up</h3>

<p class="justified">
    Subscript was born out of frustration with the rigidity of existing note-taking apps. I wanted a tool that
    respected the structure of serious, long-term note creation—especially for STEM content—and preserved the
    human presence behind each note. What emerged was a freeform handwriting-based note-taking system that
    emphasized <strong>authenticity, long-term readability, and device-independent rendering</strong>.
</p>

<p class="justified">
    All input is stored in a scalable vector-based <em>model space</em>, making it resolution-independent and
    suitable for export to <strong>PDF or web</strong>. Each note is composed of entries—either structured
    headings or freeform strokes—recorded as a collection of stylus sample points. These strokes are rendered
    using a customized Swift port of the <code>perfect-freehand</code> algorithm, with user-defined pen tips,
    stroke widths, and color selections.
</p>

<p class="justified">
    The system supports a <strong>semantic heading hierarchy (H1–H6)</strong>, which auto-generates a navigable
    table of contents. This design aligns with the philosophy of LaTeX—separating content from
    presentation—while prioritizing a beautiful reading experience over time.
</p>

<p class="justified">
    Subscript also captures something rare in today’s AI-saturated landscape: <strong>undeniable human
        authorship</strong>. No part of the note-taking flow can be faked by automation. It’s handwriting,
    structure, and thought—preserved faithfully and rendered precisely.

<h3>Used in the Real World — Chemistry 1010 (Fall 2021)</h3>

<p class="justified">
    Subscript wasn’t just a prototype it was my primary note-taking tool during an actual college-level chemistry course. I used it to produce a complete, structured set of lecture notes for <strong>Chemistry 1010 (Fall 2021)</strong>, combining handwritten formulas, semantic headings, and responsive layouts. The result is a document that remains <strong>readable, navigable, and presentation-ready</strong> years after it was written.

    The chemistry notes showcase Subscript’s ability to manage structured academic content over time, preserving both spatial arrangement and semantic organization. This example is publicly available as a web export:
